The main is located within the MidiFile class.
The Song class makes the song. You feed it the length of the song in beats , the key, and whether the last measure should be repeated.
The chord progression fo and note lengths are different for each section of the song: intro, middle and outro.
There are two marchov chain classes; one for the melody and one for the chords. These probabilities I made up from the limited music background I have.
I rimported the midi file into garage band, gave it an instrument, and added a shaker behind it.
